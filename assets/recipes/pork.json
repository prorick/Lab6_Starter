Olive oil provides richness, and broiling lends a cheesy crunch without the mess of breading and frying. The pizzalike flavors and mellow cauliflower make it a (potentially) kid-friendly meal. Feel free to omit the olives if that makes more sense for your family. In fact, this dish is highly customizable: Add more or less red-pepper flakes, throw in some capers or use broccoli rabe instead of cauliflower. Any salty, hard aged cheese will work in place of Parmesan, like asiago or pecorino. Leftovers are great crisped in the oven.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sarah DiGregorio"},"image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/25/dining/sd-farro-casserole/sd-farro-casserole-articleLarge.jpg","totalTime":"PT1H5M","recipeYield":"8 servings","recipeCuisine":"","recipeCategory":"dinner, grains and rice, main course, side dish","keywords":"cauliflower, farro, marinara sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, vegetarian","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":4,"ratingCount":500},"recipeIngredient":["1 1/2 pounds cauliflower (about 1 small cauliflower head or 1/2 large cauliflower head), florets and tender stems cut into large bite-sized pieces","1 3/4 cups semi-pearled or pearled farro (about 12 ounces)","1 (32-ounce) jar good-quality marinara sauce","1/4 cup olive oil","1/2 cup pitted kalamata or black olives, roughly chopped (optional)","8 garlic cloves, smashed and chopped","3 ounces grated Parmesan (about 3/4 cup finely grated)","1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar","1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder","1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano","1 teaspoon balsamic or sherry vinegar","1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)","1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt","Black pepper","1 cup panko","2 ounces grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup finely grated)","1 tablespoon olive oil","8 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced into rounds"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
