{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","name":"Garlic-Braised Chicken","description":"“It’s the only place where you can find a giant vat of peeled garlic, because it’s the only place that truly understands how much garlic you’ll need for the kind of food your people eat,” Michelle Zauner writes about the supermarket \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/dining/h-mart.html\"\u003eH Mart\u003c/a\u003e in her memoir, “Crying in H Mart.” Thankfully, many other grocery stores now sell containers of peeled garlic cloves. If you don’t already buy those, then this recipe is a great reason to start. Chicken thighs, white pepper, chardonnay and 20 garlic cloves are all you need for this zinger of a one-pot meal, which braises in an hour. In that time, chicken fat, wine and water turn into a luscious sauce packed with garlicky redolence. The white pepper, musky and full of earthiness, is a key taste here, so don’t skip it.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eric Kim"},"image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/10/28/dining/EK-garlic-braised-chicken/merlin_196956432_f7a2d790-6eba-4e45-8844-fc406fc7debb-articleLarge.jpg","totalTime":"PT1H15M","recipeYield":"2 to 4 servings","recipeCuisine":"","recipeCategory":"dinner, easy, weeknight, poultry, main course","keywords":"chardonnay, chicken, garlic, white pepper","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":4,"ratingCount":214},"recipeIngredient":["Olive oil","2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4)","Salt","20 peeled garlic cloves","3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper","1 cup dry chardonnay","Steamed white rice, for serving"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"HowToStep","text":"Heat oven to 350 degrees."},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"HowToStep","text":"In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom.
